Wolves are cool. I (try to) live according to Marcus Aurelius' writings which today are widely known as his "Meditations". I also like lifting weights with an emphasis on the Dead Lift. I have never thought of myself as someone who would take up programming. I know very little about computers. But, the more i read about this and get into it, the more I feel like it is suited to my strengths. I hope I am right. I may not think that when confronted with a buggy set of code I created and seemingly no way to fix it. I am sure I will do fine.
